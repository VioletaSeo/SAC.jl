# SAC.Stack

SAC.Stack is a submodule of SAC which implements simple stacking routines
to create stacks of SAC traces.

### Using

Pass an array of `SACtr` objects to the `stack` routine, with a range of times
over which to sum, and optionally times on which to align the traces, weights
to apply and the method to use.

### Available stacking methods

- `:linear` [default].  A linear (optionally weighted) stack.

"""
    stack(S::AbstractArray{SACtr}, time_range, align=zeros(length(S)), weight; method=:linear) -> s::SACtr

Return the linear stack of all traces in `S`, aligned in time on the
value in `align`, between `times[1]` and `times[end]`.

`times` can be a Tuple, Range or Array; in all cases, only the first and last values
are used.  **N.B. If using a non-integer Range, this may not include the end value
you expect.  E.g., `0.1:0.9` by default contains only the value `0.1` because the
default step is `1`.**

`align` can be a header symbol, or an array of equal length to `S`.  If it is a Symbol,
then the values in the headers are used.

All traces must have the same sampling frequency, and an error is thrown
if not all traces can be included in the stack.

If provided, traces are weighted by the values in `weight`, which are normalised
to sum to unity.
